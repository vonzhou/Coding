NAME
       od - dump files in octal and other formats

SYNOPSIS
       od [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       od [-abcdfilosx]... [FILE] [[+]OFFSET[.][b]]
       od --traditional [OPTION]... [FILE] [[+]OFFSET[.][b] [+][LABEL][.][b]]

DESCRIPTION
       Write  an  unambiguous representation, octal bytes by default, of FILE to standard out‐
       put.  With more than one FILE argument, concatenate them in the listed  order  to  form
       the input.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       All arguments to long options are mandatory for short options.

       -A, --address-radix=RADIX
              decide how file offsets are printed

       -j, --skip-bytes=BYTES
              skip BYTES input bytes first

       -N, --read-bytes=BYTES
              limit dump to BYTES input bytes

       -S, --strings[=BYTES]
              output strings of at least BYTES graphic chars

       -t, --format=TYPE
              select output format or formats

       -v, --output-duplicates
              do not use * to mark line suppression

       -w, --width[=BYTES]
              output BYTES bytes per output line

       --traditional
              accept arguments in traditional form

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

   Traditional format specifications may be intermixed; they accumulate:
       -a     same as -t a,  select named characters, ignoring high-order bit

       -b     same as -t o1, select octal bytes

       -c     same as -t c,  select ASCII characters or backslash escapes

       -d     same as -t u2, select unsigned decimal 2-byte units

       -f     same as -t fF, select floats

       -i     same as -t dI, select decimal ints

       -l     same as -t dL, select decimal longs

       -o     same as -t o2, select octal 2-byte units

       -s     same as -t d2, select decimal 2-byte units

       -x     same as -t x2, select hexadecimal 2-byte units

       If  first  and second call formats both apply, the second format is assumed if the last
       operand begins with + or (if there are 2 operands) a digit.  An OFFSET operand means -j
       OFFSET.   LABEL  is  the pseudo-address at first byte printed, incremented when dump is
       progressing.  For OFFSET and LABEL, a 0x or 0X prefix indicates  hexadecimal;  suffixes
       may be . for octal and b for multiply by 512.

       TYPE is made up of one or more of these specifications:

       a      named character, ignoring high-order bit

       c      ASCII character or backslash escape

       d[SIZE]
              signed decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       f[SIZE]
              floating point, SIZE bytes per integer

       o[SIZE]
              octal, SIZE bytes per integer

       u[SIZE]
              unsigned decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       x[SIZE]
              hexadecimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       SIZE  is  a  number.   For  TYPE  in  doux,  SIZE may also be C for sizeof(char), S for
       sizeof(short), I for sizeof(int) or L for sizeof(long).  If TYPE is f, SIZE may also be
       F for sizeof(float), D for sizeof(double) or L for sizeof(long double).

       RADIX  is  d for decimal, o for octal, x for hexadecimal or n for none.  BYTES is hexa‐
       decimal with 0x or 0X prefix, and may have a multiplier suffix: b 512, kB 1000, K 1024,
       MB  1000*1000, M 1024*1024, GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P, E,
       Z, Y.  Adding a z suffix to any type displays printable characters at the end  of  each
       output line.  Option --string without a number implies 3; option --width without a num‐
       ber implies 32.  By default, od uses -A o -t oS -w16.
